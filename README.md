The fiboArray function generates a Fibonacci sequence starting from 1 and onwards (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...) while the last member is lesser than (or equal to) the given number. The function returns an array of all generated sequence members. It uses memoization for computing Fibonacci numbers more efficiently.

I'v done like 4 versions of the main function with Fibonacci algoritm. The one that I finally deployed is the most optimized solution with Memoization than I could come up with. Another solutions (that I may also deploy, if that makes any difference) seem more effective, but they use only "while" loop or simple recursion.
