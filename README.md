The fiboArray function generates a Fibonacci sequence starting from 1 and onwards (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...) while the last member is lesser than (or equal to) the given number. The function returns an array of all generated sequence members. It uses memoization for computing Fibonacci numbers more efficiently.
